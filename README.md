We're working to integrate existing 311 data and services with user-generated advisories in an effort to enable, and make transparent, systems for maintaining civilized life.

Originally begun as an initiative to help enable mobility for low-mobility folk in times of inclement weather, our project has widened in scope to take into consideration the warmer months as well, along with an acknowledgement that mobility, more broadly considered, means __access__.

Existing 311 data references civil complaints of all kinds - from rodent issues to graffiti to potholes to snowplow requests - all of which can make an impact on the accessibility and living conditions in our fair city.

We've expanded our scope to include NYC and San Francisco.
